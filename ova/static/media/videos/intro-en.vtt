00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.000
Hello and welcome to the Open Visualization
Academy. My name is Alberto Cairo and I am

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.280
the Knight Chair in Infographics and Data
Visualization at the University of Miami.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.680
Throughout my career, in the past three decades,
I have designed hundreds of infographics. I have

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.200
taught thousands of students from all over the
world. And I have written four books about the

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.920
craft and the art of information design
and data visualization. And, even though,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.760
I think that the Open Visualization Academy is
probably my most ambitious project to date. The

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.640
Open Visualization Academy will launch on
January 31st, 2026. And I'm here to give

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.560
you an overview of its contents and also of
its contributors. For more than a decade now,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.760
I've been thinking that it would be great to
have an online platform where anybody can go

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.560
and learn about information design
and data visualization for free.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.680
And that's exactly what the Open Visualization
Academy is. For the Open Visualization Academy,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.360
I have collaborated with some of the top experts
in information design and data visualization. I'm

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.120
not going to name them all. You can just simply
take a look at our website and see who they

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.720
are. You're probably going to see many familiar
faces in there. But how is the Academy going to

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.280
be structured? Well, the Academy is going to have
three different components. The first one is going

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.000
to be an introduction to information design and
data visualization class, that I will teach. This

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.800
is going to be around five or six hours of video
in which I will cover the elementary principles of

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.720
information design and data visualization. After
my introductory class, the second component of the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.200
Open Visualization Academy is going to be a series
of specialized courses created by the experts whom

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.640
I just mentioned. Do you want to learn about
accessibility for data visualization? Well,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.760
there's going to be a course about that. Do you
want to learn about business dashboards and how

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.440
to better communicate business data? We have you
covered. Or maybe you're interested in getting a

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.280
little bit deeper into coding and programming
using R or Python. We also have content about

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.960
that. Once again, I'm not going to list every
single master class and software tutorial that

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.000
is part of the Open Visualization Academy.
You can just simply consult our website. All

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.040
that I can tell you is that I am pretty certain
that they will help you take your visualization

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.960
design skills to the next level. Besides the
video master classes and software tutorials,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.320
there is going to be a third component to the
open visualization academy, a Massive Open Online

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.840
Course (or MOOC) that I will teach myself every
year. We are still working out the details of this

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.600
MOOC. So if you want to stay up to date with it, I
would encourage you to sign up for our newsletter.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.640
You can easily do it through our website. As I
said at the beginning, the Open Visualization

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.120
Academy is my most ambitious project to date.
And I hope that by now you are as excited as I

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.840
am about it. If you are, I hope that you will join
me in this adventure. See you again in January.
